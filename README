1. Automatic Conquering Protection (isn't added):
The conquering limitations must be hard coded.
These limitations are not that complicated but also connected to the relationship between the accounts in question.
The different connection types are:
Type 1 Players were not sitters and have not used the same computer or the same network (IP) recently.
Type 2 Players have been sitters recently or have used the same network (IP).
Type 3 Players are currently sitters or used the same PC recently.
Rules for connection type 1
*can conquer village when both players have not been in the same or an allied alliance within the last 2 days
Rules for connection type 2
*can conquer village when there has been NO active sitter connection within the last 14 days AND both players have not been in the same or an allied alliance within the last 2 days
Rules for connection type 3
*can NOT conquer village of each other.
2. Alliance forum don't work 100%.
